## Description

This project was made so that you could view your workforce at a glance. It includes a manager prompt, engineer prompt and an Intern prompt.

The moment you start running the script you will be asked a series of questions, starting with the manager's information. After you add the manager's information it will request what kind of employee you want to have under them:

You can add as many employees as you'd like and then when everything is done it will confirm that it's written the html file:

You can then go into the /dist folder and load the index.html page into a browser which will reveal the page and information in an easy to read format:

If you need to view it on Mobile browsers as well I have made it so that it is easily navigable:
